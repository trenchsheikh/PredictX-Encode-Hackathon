## üé¨ Script Structure

### Opening (30 seconds)

**[Visual: Title slide with PredictX logo]**

**Voiceover:**

> "Hi, I'm [Your Name], and I'm excited to present **PredictX** ‚Äî a cross-platform responsible gambling registry built for the Encode Hackathon 2025, Concordium Responsible Gambling track.
>
> PredictX solves a critical problem in online gambling: existing safeguards are fragmented and reactive. Today, I'll show you how PredictX provides true cross-platform protection that actually prevents addiction."

**[Transition to problem slide]**

### Problem Statement (45 seconds)

**[Visual: Animation showing user jumping between platforms]**

**Voiceover:**

> "Here's the problem with current responsible gambling systems:
>
> [Show Casino A] Sarah sets a ‚Ç¨100 daily limit on Casino A to control her gambling.
>
> [Show Sarah hitting limit] She reaches her ‚Ç¨100 limit and Casino A blocks further bets. Good, right?
>
> [Show Casino B] But then Sarah just goes to Casino B, which has no idea about her limits at Casino A.
>
> [Show more money lost] She loses another ‚Ç¨100 there. Then Casino C, another ‚Ç¨100.
>
> [Show total: ‚Ç¨300] In one day, Sarah has lost ‚Ç¨300, not ‚Ç¨100. Her limit was completely ineffective because it only worked on one platform.
>
> **This is the problem PredictX solves.**"

**[Transition to solution slide]**

### Solution Overview (30 seconds)

**[Visual: PredictX architecture diagram]**

**Voiceover:**

> "PredictX is a cross-platform responsible gambling registry built on Concordium blockchain.
>
> Using Concordium's Web3 ID and anonymous identity commitments, PredictX creates a **single source of truth** for responsible gambling limits that works across **every gambling platform**.
>
> When Sarah sets a ‚Ç¨100 daily limit in PredictX, it applies to Casino A, Casino B, Casino C ‚Äî **everywhere**. No platform can bypass it."

**[Transition to live demo]**

### Live Demo Part 1: User Registration (1 minute)

**[Visual: Screen recording of PredictX demo site]**

**Voiceover:**

> "Let me show you how it works. I'm going to register as a new user on this prediction market ‚Äî which is our example gambling platform demonstrating the integration.
>
> [Click 'Connect Wallet'] First, I connect my Concordium wallet.
>
> [Identity verification modal appears] Since this is my first time, I need to complete identity verification using Concordium's Web3 ID.
>
> [Show verification process] The system verifies my age and jurisdiction using zero-knowledge proofs ‚Äî proving I'm over 18 without revealing my exact age. My real identity stays private.
>
> [Registration complete] Perfect! I'm now registered. Behind the scenes, PredictX generated an anonymous identity commitment ‚Äî a Blake2b hash ‚Äî that's unique to me but reveals no personal information.
>
> [Show default limits] I've been assigned default limits: ‚Ç¨100 per day, ‚Ç¨500 per week, ‚Ç¨2000 per month. Let me customize these."

**[Show limit configuration]**

> "I'm going to set a ‚Ç¨50 daily limit to be extra cautious.
>
> [Save limits] Done. Now let's test the system."

---

### Live Demo Part 2: Normal Bet (30 seconds)

**[Visual: Placing a bet within limits]**

**Voiceover:**

> "I'm going to place a ‚Ç¨30 bet on this market.
>
> [Enter amount] ‚Ç¨30... 
>
> [Click 'Place Bet'] Before accepting my bet, the platform calls the PredictX API to check if it's allowed.
>
> [Show API call in network tab] See this? `POST /api/rg/check` ‚Äî checking my limits in real-time.
>
> [Bet successful] ‚úÖ Approved! I'm at ‚Ç¨30 of my ‚Ç¨50 daily limit. The bet goes through normally."

---

### Live Demo Part 3: Limit Exceeded (30 seconds)

**[Visual: Attempting bet that exceeds limits]**

**Voiceover:**

> "Now let's try to place a ‚Ç¨30 bet again.
>
> [Enter ‚Ç¨30] 
>
> [Click 'Place Bet'] The system checks...
>
> [Error message appears] ‚ùå Blocked! 'Would exceed daily limit (‚Ç¨30/‚Ç¨50 used)'
>
> [Highlight error] The platform won't let me place this bet because it would take me over my ‚Ç¨50 limit. The blockchain is enforcing my limit ‚Äî I can't bypass it."

---

### Live Demo Part 4: Cross-Platform Enforcement (1 minute) üåü **KEY DEMO**

**[Visual: Open "different platform" in new tab]**

**Voiceover:**

> "Here's where PredictX shines ‚Äî **cross-platform enforcement**.
>
> [Show tab labeled 'Casino B'] Imagine this is a completely different gambling platform ‚Äî Casino B, if you will.
>
> [Same user logs in] I log in with the same Concordium wallet. Behind the scenes, it generates the **same identity commitment** because it's based on my wallet address.
>
> [Check RG status] Look at my RG status here on 'Casino B' ‚Äî it shows I've already spent ‚Ç¨30 today!
>
> [Try to place ‚Ç¨30 bet] Let me try to place another ‚Ç¨30 bet here...
>
> [Blocked again] ‚ùå Blocked! 'Would exceed daily limit (‚Ç¨30/‚Ç¨50 used)'
>
> **This is the game-changer.** Even though this is a completely different platform, operated by a completely different company, my limits still apply! 
>
> [Emphasize] In traditional systems, each platform has its own limits. With PredictX, limits follow the user **everywhere**."

---

### Live Demo Part 5: Self-Exclusion (30 seconds)

**[Visual: Self-exclusion feature]**

**Voiceover:**

> "PredictX also supports self-exclusion. 
>
> [Click 'Self-Exclude'] If I realize I have a problem, I can exclude myself from all gambling for a set period.
>
> [Select 30 days] Let's say 30 days...
>
> [Confirm] This is irreversible for 30 days ‚Äî even I can't undo it.
>
> [Try to bet] Now if I try to place any bet...
>
> [Blocked] ‚ùå 'Self-excluded for 29 more days'
>
> [Switch to 'Casino B'] And on the other platform?
>
> [Also blocked] ‚ùå Same thing. Self-exclusion works across **all platforms**."

---

### Technical Highlights (30 seconds)

**[Visual: Code snippets and architecture]**

**Voiceover:**

> "Let me quickly show the technical implementation.
>
> [Show smart contract] Here's the Concordium smart contract in Rust. It handles user registration, limit validation, and self-exclusion ‚Äî all on-chain.
>
> [Show API endpoint] Gambling platforms integrate using simple REST APIs. Just two calls: check before bet, record after bet.
>
> [Show identity commitment code] Identity commitments are generated using Blake2b hashing ‚Äî completely anonymous, but unique and verifiable.
>
> [Show euroe integration] We use Concordium's euroe stablecoin for payments ‚Äî protocol-level EUR-backed stablecoin for consistent, compliant transactions."

---

### Impact & Innovation (20 seconds)

**[Visual: Impact statistics slide]**

**Voiceover:**

> "Why does PredictX matter?
>
> **For Users**: True protection that actually works, across all platforms they use.
>
> **For Operators**: Easy 2-hour integration, meets compliance requirements, competitive advantage.
>
> **For Regulators**: Transparent, auditable, privacy-preserving ‚Äî all gambling activity tracked without compromising user privacy.
>
> **For Society**: Real addiction prevention, not just lip service."

---

### Closing (20 seconds)

**[Visual: Thank you slide with links]**

**Voiceover:**

> "PredictX is the only responsible gambling solution that truly works across platforms, thanks to Concordium's blockchain-native identity layer.
>
> I'm excited to submit this for the Encode Hackathon and would love to bring this to production to help make online gambling safer for everyone.
>
> Thank you for watching! Check out our GitHub for the full code, documentation, and integration guide.
