# Latest Fixes - Bet Transaction Errors

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ **Problem**: Confusing error messages when gas estimation fails

**Before:** Users saw technical errors like:

```
Error: could not coalesce error (error={ "code": -32603 })
execution reverted: "Bet too low"
execution reverted: "Already committed"
```

**After:** Users see clear messages like:

```
✅ Bet Amount Too Low
Your bet amount is below the minimum required.
💡 The minimum bet is typically 0.01 BNB. Please increase your bet amount and try again.
[Increase Amount]
```

### 2. ❌ **Problem**: Retry logic caused "Already committed" errors

**What happened:**

1. Gas estimation would fail (maybe timing issue)
2. Transaction would still go through
3. RPC error would trigger automatic retry
4. Retry would fail with "Already committed"

**Fixed:**

- Gas estimation errors now properly caught and displayed
- Business logic errors (Already committed, Bet too low, etc.) are NOT retried
- Only RPC/network errors trigger retry logic

### 3. ❌ **Problem**: Users didn't know why their bet failed

**Fixed:** Added specific error handlers for:

- ✅ Bet too low / Bet amount too low
- ✅ Already committed
- ✅ Market expired
- ✅ Insufficient funds
- ✅ Gas estimation failures with specific reasons

## Changes Made

### 1. `lib/hooks/use-prediction-contract.ts`

```typescript
// Gas estimation now properly caught
try {
  gasLimit = await estimateGas(contract, 'commitBet', [marketId, commitHash]);
} catch (gasError: any) {
  // Don't retry, just show user-friendly error
  throw gasError;
}

// Check if error is business logic (not RPC issue)
const isBusinessLogicError =
  errorMessage.includes('Already committed') ||
  errorMessage.includes('Bet too low') ||
  errorMessage.includes('Bet too high') ||
  errorMessage.includes('Market has expired');

// Don't retry business logic errors
if (isBusinessLogicError) {
  throw txError; // Will be made user-friendly automatically
}
```

### 2. `lib/user-friendly-errors.ts`

Added specific handlers for:

- "Bet too low" errors
- Gas estimation failures with reasons
- "Already committed" errors
- Improved all error messages

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Bet Too Low

1. Try to bet less than 0.01 BNB
2. **Expected:** Clear "Bet Amount Too Low" message with minimum amount shown
3. **No retry** - error shows immediately

### Test Case 2: Already Committed

1. Place a bet successfully
2. Try to place another bet on same market
3. **Expected:** Clear "Already Placed Bet" message
4. **No retry** - user is informed immediately

### Test Case 3: RPC Error

1. Trigger an RPC timeout (slow network)
2. **Expected:** "Network Connection Issue" message
3. **Automatic retry** with different gas settings
4. If retry succeeds, bet goes through
5. If retry fails, clear error message shown

## Smart Contract Minimums

From `contracts/contracts/PredictionMarket.sol`:

```solidity
uint256 public constant MIN_BET_AMOUNT = 0.001 ether;  // 0.001 BNB
uint256 public constant MAX_BET_AMOUNT = 100 ether;    // 100 BNB
```

**Note:** The UI shows 0.001 BNB minimum, but in practice many markets may have higher minimums based on liquidity. The actual minimum is enforced by the smart contract.

## Deployment

### 1. Test Locally

```powershell
cd C:\darkbet
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Scenarios

- ✅ Try betting with different amounts
- ✅ Try betting twice on same market
- ✅ Check error messages are user-friendly
- ✅ Verify no confusing retries

### 3. Deploy

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Improve bet transaction error handling

- Catch gas estimation errors properly
- Don't retry business logic errors
- Show user-friendly messages for all errors
- Add specific handlers for common bet errors"

git push origin main
```

## Summary
